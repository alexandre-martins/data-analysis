# data-analysis

Hello!  

I'am Alexandre, a brazilian chemical engineer who is trying to learn data science.  

This is a simple repository where I keep notebooks that I use mainly for studying. 
I try to bring more of the context of the datasets into my analysis, approaching it with a broader view. This, I think, makes the analysis more complete and fun.  

If you have any suggestions, corrections or just want to colaborate into any of my projects, feel super free to do so! :)  
I'am open to learn, always. Just contact me in case you want to tell something or help to improve any of the projects.
